# Role Call (WIP)

Role Call helps game masters run and manage in-person hidden role games. The aim isn't to take away from the frenetic experience of a scrum debate - it's more to make a GM's life easier and prevent mishaps and mistakes.

## Planned features:

- Role allocation - give your players random roles that only they will know
- Custom games - create your own roles with their own win conditions
- Single source of truth
- Simple, secure signup process - head to the website, throw in your phone number and join a game
- Moderation - remove players from games in the event of forfeit, sudden absence or misconduct
- Easy ways to keep track of games - list players, roles and states, and see the current game phase (night/day/discussion/voting)

## Credits

- Basic roles adapted from BlankMediaGames' *Town of Salem*
